This is a repository for each remaining Rustbook tutorial, unless such an occasion arises that a new repository would be needed.

Now that I have learned how to create new scripts (and therefore don't have to always work out of main.rs), I can create new scripts for each tutorial rather than making a new repository each time. I apologise for cluttering my page prior to this, it has been a learning experience!

Each script is made as per the documentation at https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html and mostly serve to be a learning exercise rather than a finished product and it is not recommended that any of these be used for your own projects unless you know what you're doing. If you wish further context, please refer to the Rust book.

And in the off-chance anyone is actually reading this - I hope you're having a great day! :)
